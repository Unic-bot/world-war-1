            <h2>The beginning of the Great War. The assassination in Sarajevo</h2>

            <p>The assassination on 28 June 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Duchess Sophie Hohenberg, in Sarajevo by Serbian high school student Gavrilo Princip, a member of a group of six terrorists (five Serbs and one Bosnian) coordinated by Danilo Ilić.</p>

            <p>The political goal of the assassination was to separate the South Slavic territories from Austria-Hungary and subsequently annex them to Greater Serbia or Yugoslavia. Members of the group were in contact with a Serbian terrorist organisation called the Black Hand. The assassination became the pretext for the start of World War I. Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which was partially rejected, whereupon Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.</p>

            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

            <p>Under the Treaty of Berlin of 1878, Austria-Hungary was granted a mandate to occupy and administer the Bosnian Vilayet, a significant part of whose population was Serbian, while maintaining the formal sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire. Under the same treaty, the Great Powers (Austria-Hungary, the British Empire, France, the German Empire, Italy, the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire) recognised the sovereignty of the Serbian Principality.</p>

            <p>Four years later, the principality was transformed into the Kingdom of Serbia, headed by Prince Milan IV Obrenović (after the transformation, King Milan I). After his death, his son Alexander Obrenović became king. Both kings maintained close relations with Austria-Hungary, based on respect for the borders established by the treaty.</p>

            <p>The situation changed dramatically in May 1903, when Serbian officers led by Dragutin Dimitrijević stormed the royal palace and brutally murdered King Alexander and his wife Draga (48 bullets were fired at them: 30 at Alexander and 18 at Draga). Their bodies were stripped, torn apart and thrown into the palace garden. The chief of the guard and the queen's two brothers were also killed. Peter I of the Karadjordjevic dynasty, a popular ruler among the people, became the new king.</p>

            <p>The new dynasty was more nationalistic and friendly towards Russia than the previous one. In the following years, Serbia actively fought for territorial expansion. This led to a customs conflict with Austria-Hungary in 1906 (known as the ‘Pork War’), the Bosnian crisis of 1908–1909, and then the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, during which Serbia expanded its territory at the expense of the Ottoman Empire and prevented Bulgaria from growing stronger.</p>

            <p>Serbia's successes inspired nationalists to fight against Austria-Hungary. In Serbia and Bosnia, terrorists carried out a series of attacks on Austro-Hungarian officials. One of them was a student named Bogdan Žeraic, who attempted to assassinate the governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Marjan Varešanin, on 15 June 1910. Žeraic fired five shots and then shot himself. His actions inspired future terrorists, including Princip and Nedeljko Čabrinović. Princip said: ‘Zeraich was my first role model. At the age of 17, I spent the whole night at his grave, thinking about our desperate situation and about him. It was there that I decided to carry out an assassination attempt sooner or later.’</p>

            <p>In 1913, Emperor Franz Joseph appointed Franz Ferdinand as an observer of military manoeuvres in Bosnia, scheduled for June 1914. After the manoeuvres, the Archduke and his wife planned to visit Sarajevo for the opening of the State Museum. According to their son, Duke Maximilian, the duchess accompanied her husband because she feared for his safety.</p>

            <p>Duchess Sophie was considered a commoner at the Austrian court. Franz Joseph agreed to their marriage only on condition that their children would never inherit the throne. Their 14th wedding anniversary fell on 28 June. Historian Alan Taylor wrote:</p>

            <blockquote>
                Sophie could never share [Franz Ferdinand's] title... could never share his splendour, could never even sit next to him at a public event. There was one loophole... his wife could enjoy the recognition of her rank when he was involved in military affairs. So, in 1914, he decided to inspect the army in Bosnia. There, in its capital Sarajevo, the Archduke and his wife could ride side by side in an open car... Thus, for the sake of love, the Archduke went to his death."

                <h2>The assassination of the Archduke and the political crisis</h2>

               <p>The formal pretext for the war was the Sarajevo assassination: on 28 June 1914 the 19-year-old Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip shot in Sarajevo the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife, the Czech Sophie Chotek, who had arrived in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed in 1908. Franz Ferdinand — heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne — was a Slavophile and advocated creating a federation of Austrian, Hungarian and Slavic lands under Habsburg patronage. On his side, Gavrilo Princip belonged to the organization “Mlada Bosna” (“Young Bosnia”), founded in 1912 on the model of the Italian underground movement “Young Italy” and proclaiming the struggle for the unification of all South Slavic peoples into a single state — a Greater Serbia.Main article: The July Ultimatum. On 5 July Kaiser Wilhelm II, at a confidential meeting with the Austro-Hungarian ambassador in Berlin, Ladislaus Segenyi, assured him that Austria-Hungary could “count on Germany’s full support” in a conflict with Serbia. Segenyi reported this the same day to Austro-Hungary’s foreign minister, Leopold von Berchtold. On 6 July British foreign secretary Edward Grey met the German ambassador Karl Lichnowsky. Lichnowsky assured him that Austria did not plan to annex Serbian territory, expressed hope for British influence in St. Petersburg to incline Serbia to make concessions, and voiced concern about Russia’s hostile stance. Grey, for his part, assured of Russia’s peaceful intentions, denied the existence of secret political agreements between Britain and Russia, and promised to help achieve mutual understanding between the Triple Alliance and the Entente.
               On 7 July at a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Vienna it was decided to present Serbia with an ultimatum and, if it was rejected, “to resolve the matter by military intervention.” On 8 July Grey informed the Russian ambassador Benckendorff of the likelihood of an Austrian offensive and denied the opinion that Wilhelm II did not want war, stressing Germany’s hostility toward Russia. On 9 July Grey and Lichnowsky met again. Grey once more affirmed that Britain was not bound to France and Russia by treaty obligations and sought peace. He said he was trying to convince the Russian government to adopt a restrained position toward Austria.On 18 July Russian foreign minister Sazonov told the German ambassador Purtales that Russia could not remain indifferent to Austria-Hungary’s actions in Belgrade and “could not allow the humiliation of Serbia.” From 20 to 22 July President Poincaré of France and Prime Minister Viviani visited Russia. They assured that France would fulfil its allied obligations in the event of war with Germany.Residents of Berlin read the announcement of general mobilization. On 20 July Grey proposed beginning direct negotiations between Austria and Russia. Poincaré rejected this as dangerous and proposed that the governments of England, France and Russia issue a joint counsel of moderation to Austria-Hungary.On 23 July Austria-Hungary sent Serbia an ultimatum with a number of harsh demands, including a ban on anti-Austrian propaganda, the dissolution of organizations, the removal of officials, and admission of Austrian representatives to participate in the investigation of Franz Ferdinand’s murder. The same day Grey met for the first time with the Austrian ambassador Mensdorff, who informed him of the ultimatum’s contents. Grey refused to discuss it on its merits. On 24 July the ultimatum was officially handed to the British government. Grey told the German ambassador about the possibility of a “war of four powers” if Austria invaded Serbia, and proposed “mediation by four powers” (England, France, Germany, Italy). Germany agreed; France and Russia refused.That same day meetings were held in Russia where Minister Sazonov declared: “This is a European war!” It was decided to prepare for the mobilization of four military districts and the fleet, and to withdraw Russian state deposits from German banks. On 25 July a Council of Ministers meeting chaired by Nicholas II took place at Krasnoye Selo. It was decided to bring the army to combat readiness and to take measures for a partial secret mobilization. 26 July was declared the beginning of the “preparatory period for war.” These measures were taken before the ultimatum was rejected and before any declaration of war. In France a covert mobilization began: troops were recalled from maneuvers and officers were summoned from leave.That same day Serbia announced general mobilization and at 18:00 responded to the ultimatum. Most points were accepted with reservations, while the demand to admit Austrian representatives to the investigation was rejected. Austria-Hungary broke off diplomatic relations. On 26 July Sazonov met with the Austrian ambassador Szapáry and then sent to Minister Berchtold a proposal to soften the ultimatum. A reply came only on 29 July and was negative. King George V on the same day assured Prince Henry, the Kaiser’s brother, that Britain would make efforts to preserve neutrality. Grey proposed convening a “conference of ambassadors.” Later he admitted that his proposals had given Russia and France time to prepare militarily.On 27 July the British fleet received orders to remain at Portland. At a cabinet meeting Grey demanded Britain’s participation in the war, threatening to resign. Most ministers opposed war, but Asquith, Churchill and Holden supported Grey. Grey informed the German ambassador that he was satisfied with Serbia’s reply to the ultimatum and urged Germany to restrain Austria’s “reckless policy.” On 28 July Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and began shelling Belgrade. Russia protested against the occupation of Serbia, and leaves in France were suspended. Emperor Wilhelm II, having read Serbia’s reply, expressed the opinion that it was sufficient and that there was no reason for war. He suggested limiting actions to occupying Belgrade and beginning negotiations. Sazonov met with the ambassadors of the European powers and circulated a statement that further negotiations with Austria-Hungary after the start of hostilities were pointless.On the night of 28–29 July the British fleet left Portland for the war base at Scapa Flow. On 29 July Grey told the German ambassador that Britain would remain neutral while the conflict was limited to Austria and Russia, but that in the event of Germany and France becoming involved it would be compelled to take urgent measures.</p>
